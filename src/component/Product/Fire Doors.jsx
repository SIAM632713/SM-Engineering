                    A Fire Door is a specially engineered door designed to resist the spread of fire, smoke, and heat for a specified periodâ€”typically 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. These doors are an essential component of passive fire protection systems in buildings and are built using fire-resistant materials such as steel, gypsum, or fire-rated timber. Fire doors are tested and certified according to international standards like BS 476, EN 1634, or UL 10C to ensure they can withstand fire for their rated duration.
